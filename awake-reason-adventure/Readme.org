* Awake Reason Adventure
- A bird's eye view adventure made with:
  - maps:  Emacs artist-mode,
  - simple Javascript: html/canvas, requestAnimationFrame
** DONE for now:
- Pacman: blue square can eat the map, congrats! :-)
** TODO next up:
- detect map collisions
- meet NPCs (non-player characters) telling stories, insightful video?
